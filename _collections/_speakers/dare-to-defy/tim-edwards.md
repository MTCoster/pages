Tim Edwards is a founding trustee of The Bhopal Medical Appeal (BMA), an organisation that funds medical relief in Bhopal, devoted to aiding chronically-ill survivors of the gas disaster. In 1984, half a million people were exposed to a lethal gas that escaped a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India. Tim was inspired by the strength of the survivors after visiting the city 15 years later, and has been advocating on behalf of Bhopal ever since, advising on the social, legal, environmental and medical complexities of Union Carbide's disaster. The BMA currently supports the Sambhavna medical clinic and the Chingari Rehabilitation Center. Both clinics provide direct treatment and support to over 70,000 gas and toxic water-affected people.

Tim will share with us the forgotten story of Bhopal and his journey in founding an organisation, aimed at caring for those still enduring horrific illnesses from the man-made chemical disaster.
