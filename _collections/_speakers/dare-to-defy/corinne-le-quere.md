Professor Corinne Le Quéré FRS is the Director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and a Professor of Climate Change Science and Policy at the University of East Anglia. In 2017, she chaired the International Panel of the *Make the Planet Great Again* campaign led by French President Emmanuel Macron, which awarded grants to outstanding climate scientists around the world. Le Quéré also initiates and directs the yearly update of the Global Carbon Budget, a publication by the Global Carbon Project which aims to inform readers about the latest developments in global and national carbon cycle changes. A member of the UK Committee on Climate Change and author of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Corinne has contributed to advances in the quantification of the causes and trends of atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as the use and development of carbon cycle models in carbon budgets.

Recognised among the 20 "women making waves in the climate change debate" in the *Road to Paris* journal, we are honoured to have Corinne deliver what will undoubtedly be an inspiring talk on the ever-pressing issue of climate change, with particular focus on its interaction with the carbon cycle.
