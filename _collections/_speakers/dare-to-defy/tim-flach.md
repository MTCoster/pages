Tim Flach is an acclaimed animal photographer with an interest in the way humans regard animals, derived from his concerns with anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism. He is the author of the books *Endangered*, *Evolution*, *Equus*, and *More Than Human*. His projects are well-known for the originality that they bring to conceptually capturing animal behavior and characteristics, and have been displayed all over the world, from Japan to Russia to the United States. Tim's latest major body of work, titled *Endangered*, is a powerful visual record of animals that find themselves on the edge of extinction.

In his talk, Tim will be exploring the complexity of the animal kingdom through the lens of a photographer, underpinned by a distinctive interest in how we can better connect people to the natural world.
