Michael Morel is a campaigner for the Open Rights Group (ORG), an organisation which serves to defend our personal rights and freedoms in the digital sphere. Michael is equipped with an MA in Government as well as BAs in Political Science and Physical Anthropology and has previously worked as a media reform advocate, having written on topics such as net neutrality, political polarisation and media bias. Currently, Michael runs ORG's digital campaigns and provides support to local ORG groups across the country.

Relying on his extensive experience and knowledge on the subject, Michael will give us an insight into the ongoing struggle for the preservation of digital rights, especially with Trump's recent repeal, daring to defy in his endeavour to protect the privileges we too often take for granted---privacy and free speech.
