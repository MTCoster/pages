Harnaam Kaur, also known as the youngest woman in the world to have a full beard, is a body positivity advocate, anti-bullying activist, model and world record holder. Born in England, Harnaam was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, causing an imbalance of hormones, and spent her youth removing the unwanted body hair to avoid taunts from her peers. However, after years of hiding, at the age of 16 she decided to embrace her body and today is a spokesperson on diversity and self-acceptance. Harnaam has walked London Fashion Week, and has contributed to the House of Parliament on mental health, body image and LGBTQIA issues. Recently, Harnaam created a report on social media and body image for the British Council Youth Select Committee.

In her speech, Harnaam will take us on a journey from self-hate to self-love, drawing on her inspirational personal experience to encourage the audience to embrace their beauty, whatever form it comes in.
