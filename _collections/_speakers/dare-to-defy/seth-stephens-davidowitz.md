A Harvard-trained economist, former data analyst at Google and New York Times writer, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz has devoted the past four years to perusing anonymous Google search histories, Facebook posts and other digital platforms. By delving into the deepest recesses of this big-data goldmine, Seth's bestselling book *Everybody Lies* offers groundbreaking insight into the anxieties, desires and prejudices which lurk in the deepest recesses of the human psyche.

From sexuality to homicidal ideation, hate speech to parental favouritism, Seth challenges us to think differently about the facades and biases we uphold---as revealed in our private online searches---and their real-world implications.
