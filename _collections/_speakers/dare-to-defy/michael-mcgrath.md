Diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy at the age of 18 in 1984, Michael made history 20 years later by becoming the first---and only---disabled person to lead expeditions to the North and South Poles. The journey gave rise to a new life trajectory which propelled Michael into a vibrant career as founder and CEO of The Muscle Help Foundation, a multi-award winning family charity that delivers transformational experiences to children with muscular dystrophy. Michael was recognized by the Queen in 2004 for his 'contribution to national life' and received the *2005 Business Traveler of the Year Award* in Dubai. A Paralympic Torchbearer in 2012, he was named one of the most influential disabled people in Britain, featuring in *Power 100* 2016 and 2017.

By any standard, Michael's phenomenal achievements are a testament to his leadership, teamwork, meticulous foresight, compassion and unwavering resilience in the face of adversity -- universally important traits which he will explore in his talk.
